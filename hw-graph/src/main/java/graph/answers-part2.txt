A few examples of possible Graph representations:

    A: A collection of nodes and a collection of edges.
    B: An adjacency list, in which each node is associated with a list of its outgoing edges.
    C: An adjacency matrix, which explicitly represents, for every pair ⟨A,B⟩ of edges, whether there is a link from A to B, and how many.

1. In two or three sentences, explain an advantage and a disadvantage of each of the
representations listed above (for example, in terms of runtime complexity, space
complexity, or ease of implementation).
Collections:
Adjacency list:
Adjacency matrix:

2. In two to three sentences, describe the representation you chose and explain why you
chose it. If you chose to use a different representation than one of the three we described
above, be sure to list its advantages and disadvantages, too.
I chose to use an adjacency list, where I have a HashMap<String, ArrayList<Edge>>.
I chose this representation because

    (Please keep your answers brief and to-the-point.)

1. Describe any new tests you added and why you added them, or why you feel that your original
tests alone are sufficient.




2. Did you make any changes to your specifications as you were implementing your Graph? (yes/no)
If yes, describe your changes and why you made them.

Yes; I made a few changes regarding the methods my Graph ADT had and a private inner class:
I added an Edge private class to maintain an edge. It contains 2 getters, hashCode, and equals,
as recommended by the spec. This is so that it is easier to keep track of each edge and its relation
to surrounding nodes. I added a class field graphList that stores all the nodes and the corresponding edges
I also added remove methods for edges and nodes, a containsNode method, a size method, a clear method,
an isEmpty method, and a getEdges method. This is so that I have more flexibility in terms of managing a
graph, for later work when I use my Graph ADT
