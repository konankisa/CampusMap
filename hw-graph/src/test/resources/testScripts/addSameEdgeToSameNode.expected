# Creates an empty graph, adds 2 nodes to it,
# and adds the same edge to the same nodes,
# then checks the children

# Create a graph
created graph graph

# Add a node to graph
added node node1 to graph

# Add another node to graph
added node node2 to graph

# Add an edge from node1 to node2 in graph
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in graph

# Add the same edge from node1 to node2 in graph
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in graph

# List the children of the parent node
the children of node1 in graph are: node2(edge1)
