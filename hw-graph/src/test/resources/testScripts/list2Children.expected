# Create a graph
created graph graph

# Add a node
added node node1 to graph

# Add another node
added node node2 to graph

# Add a third node
added node node3 to graph

# Add an edge from node1 to node2 in graph
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in graph

# Add another edge from node1 to node3 in graph
added edge edge2 from node1 to node3 in graph

# List the children of the parent node
the children of node1 in graph are: node2(edge1) node3(edge2)
