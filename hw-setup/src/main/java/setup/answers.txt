1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
The test failed because the exception was thrown for when n = 0, but 0 is nonnegative. I just had to change the
condition to not include 0 in it.


2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.



3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
