1. Multiplication Pseudocode
r = p * q:
    set r = 0
    {Inv r = q*p_0 + q*p_1 + ... + q*p_i-1, where p_j is the jth term in p}
    foreach term, t_p, in p:
        {Inv r = q_1*p_j + q_2*p_j + ... + q_i-1*p_j, where q_k is the kth term in q}
        foreach term, t_q, in q:
            set t_s = t_p * t_q
            add t_s to r (polynomial addition)


2. Division Pseudocode
q = u / v:
    set r = u by making a term-by-term copy of all terms in u to r
    set polynomial q = 0
    {Inv u = polynomial addition of (polynomial multiplication of q and v) and r}
    while r != 0 and highest degree of r >= highest degree of v:
        set div = leading term of r / leading term of v
        set deg = highest degree of r - highest degree of v
        set s to be a polynomial which has degree deg and the coefficient of div as the coefficient
        replace q with the sum of q and s
        replace r with r - (s * v)


3. Division Example: (x3+x-1) / (x+1) = x2-x+2
x^2-x+2 = (x^3+x-1)/(x+1)
    set r = copy of u = x^3+x-1
    set q = 0
    while r != 0 (YES) and highest degree of r (3) >= highest degree of v (1):
        Iteration 1: r = x^3+x-1, q = 0
            set div = x^3/x = x^2
            set deg = 3-1 = 2
            set s = x^2
            replace 0 with 0 + x^2
            replace x^3+x-1 with x^3+x-1 - (x^3+x^2) = -x^2+x-1
        Iteration 2: r = -x^2+x-1, q = x^2, r != 0, highest deg of r (2) >= highest deg of v (1)
            set div = -x^2/x = -x
            set deg = 2-1 = 1
            set s = -x
            replace x^2 with x^2-x
            replace -x^2+x-1 with -x^2+x-1 - (-x^2-x) = 2x-1
        Iteration 3: r = 2x-1, q = x^2-x, r != 0, highest deg of r (1) >= highest deg of v (1)
            set div = 2x/x = 2
            set deg = 1-1 = 0
            set s = 2
            replace x^2-x with x^2-x+2
            replace 2x-1 with 2x-1 - (2x+2) = -3
        Now, since highest deg of r (0) !>= highest deg of v (1), we exit the loop
    We are done! q = x^2-x+2

1. Weakened Rep Invariant
We would take out the GCD method call within the RatNum() constructor with 2 parameters to adhere to the
new rep invariant, which would make the constructor more efficient as it doesn't need to run a loop.
CheckRep() would also have to get rid of the GCD call since we don't need to check for the reduced forms.
We would have to add a GCD method call in equals() and hashCode(), as they require reduced fractions to
compare and return the same hashcode or to return true, which makes the methods less efficient.
toString() also has to use the GCD method within in order to get the reduced form for fractions, which would
also be less efficient


2. Alternate add, sub, mul, div
These changes fail to meet the specifications of the methods because the methods do not indicate
whether this is modified via a modifies clause. Furthermore, this fails the class specifications
as the specs show that RatNum indicates an immutable rational number, yet the changes mutate RatNum.


3. Constructor checkReps
It is sufficient to call checkRep only at the end of the constructors because RatNum is an
immutable rational number, and its variables are declared as final, meaning they're only
initialized once and unable to be modified. Also, all the methods in RatNum return new RatNums
without modifying the old ones, thus the rep invariant is held true by checkRep.

1. Calls to checkRep in RatTerm
I added checkRep at the end of constructor for the same reason as in RatNum: RatTerm is immutable
and its variables are final, meaning they're initialized once and are unmodifiable. Furthermore,
all the methods in the class return new RatTerms without modifying the old ones, therefore the
rep invariant is held true by checkRep.

1. Calls to checkRep in RatPoly
I added checkRep at the end of constructor for the same reason as in RatNum: RatPoly is immutable
and its variable is final, meaning it's initialized once and is unmodifiable. Furthermore,
all the methods in the class return new RatPolys without modifying the old ones, therefore the
rep invariant is held true by checkRep.
