1. Multiplication Pseudocode
r = p * q:
    set r = 0
    {Inv r = q*p_0 + q*p_1 + ... + q*p_i-1, where p_j is the jth term in p}
    foreach term, t_p, in p:
        {Inv r = q_1*p_j + q_2*p_j + ... + q_i-1*p_j, where q_k is the kth term in q}
        foreach term, t_q, in q:
            set t_s = t_p * t_q
            if any term, t_r, in r has the same degree as t_s,
                then replace t_r with the sum of t_r and t_s
                else insert t_s into r as a new term


2. Division Pseudocode
q = u / v:
    set r = u by making a term-by-term copy of all terms in u to r
    set q = 0
    {Inv u = (q * v) + r}
    while r != 0 and highest degree of r >= highest degree of v:
        set div = leading term of r / leading term of v
        set deg = highest degree of r - highest degree of v
        insert a term s, which has degree deg and the coefficient of div, into q as a new term
        replace r with r - (s * v)


3. Division Example: (x3+x-1) / (x+1) = x2-x+2

1. Weakened Rep Invariant
We would take out the GCD method call within the RatNum constructor with 2 parameters to adhere to the
new rep invariant, which would make the constructor more efficient as it doesn't need to run a loop.
We would have to add a GCD method call in equals and hashCode as well, as they require reduced fractions to
compare and return the same hashcode or to return true, which makes the methods less efficient.
toString also has to use the GCD method within in order to get the reduced form for fractions, which would
also be less efficient


2. Alternate add, sub, mul, div
These changes fail to meet the specifications of the methods because the methods do not indicate
whether this is modified via a modifies clause. Furthermore, this fails the class specifications
as the spec show that RatNum indicates an immutable rational number, yet the changes mutate RatNum.


3. Constructor checkReps
It is sufficient to call checkRep only at the end of the constructors because RatNum is an
immutable rational number, and its variables are declared as final, meaning they're only
initialized once and unable to be modified. Also, all the methods in RatNum return new RatNums
without modifying the old ones, thus the rep invariant is held true by checkRep.

1. Calls to checkRep in RatTerm
I added checkRep at the end of constructor for the same reason as in RatNum: RatTerm is immutable
and its variables are final, meaning they're initialized once and are unmodifiable. Furthermore,
all the methods in the class return new RatTerms without modifying the old ones, therefore the
rep invariant is held true by checkRep.
