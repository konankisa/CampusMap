Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.
Alongside modifying my ADT, test drivers, and other files to accommodate for the generics being implemented,
I decided to change my Edge class to not implement Comparable, and use Comparators wherever I needed to instead.
I felt that it would be more convenient than having my Edge implement Comparable, because it allows for more
flexibility when comparing objects.
